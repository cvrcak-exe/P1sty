P1sty is a python Tool that allows you to generate fully coded P1sty spiders 
for any given paste website in less than a second.

P1sty's spiders allows you to monitor a given paste website for occurrence of
 your business name, domain, emails, credentials, Credit cards, etc.

Once the fraudulent information is detected, you will be notified in real time
by e-mail, and a MISP event will be automatically created.

In case of true positive alert, you should inform your Fraud departement also
you can notify your MISP community.

## Examples

Let's suppose your domain is p1sty.com and your Bank BIN is 123456 and you want to monitor pastebin.com, pastebin.fr, gist.github.com, paste.debian.net,etc for occurance of your domain, urls, emails, credentials and your credit cards.
There is no need to develop for each website a specific crawler from scratch because with p1sty, you can generate a fully coded spider in less than a second based on specific parameters.

Example 1: monitoring pastebin.com (Without email notification)
~~~
$ python p1sty.py -n "pastebin" -s "http://pastebin.com/archive" -m "https://Misp_URL/events" -k "MISP key" -lpx "//tr/td[1]/a/@href" -rpx "//textarea/text()" -ux "//div[@class='username']/a/text()" -d "p1sty.com" -b "123456"

$ scrapy crawl pastebin 
~~~
Example 2: monitoring pastebin.fr (With email notification)

~~~
$ python p1sty.py -n "pastebin_fr" -s "http://pastebin.fr/" -m "https://Misp_URL/events" -k "MISP key" -lpx "//a[contains(@href,'http://pastebin.fr/')]/@href" -rpx "//textarea/text()" -ux "//div/h1/em/text()" -d "p1sty.com" -b "123456" -se "sender email" -p "password" -r "recipient email"

$ scrapy crawl pastebin_fr
~~~

# P1sty spiders to MISP
Besides extracting raw paste data, p1sty spiders extract usernames, Bitcoin addresses, email addresses, cards numbers and add it to MISP event as attributes and enable their correlation.
In this case, we will be able to correlate all of our findings to identify who is the criminal/malicious group behind data exposure.
We all know that most criminals uses single bitcoin address, so when a criminal adds parts of card or credential dumps and then mentions his Bitcoin address, we can identify all usernames used by him in different paste websites, this will allows us to perform tracking and we may be able to identify him ;)

# Are we limited to that ?

Of course not, this project was developed for an article about Fraud prevention :) 

The article is available on [Medium](https://medium.com/@jonathan.benalii/p1sty-for-fraud-prevention-18f8e122586?source=friends_link&sk=fac669a6ec9fa8b0c04372191e4d5e19)


In the following articles, i will extend P1sty to monitor dark web also i will develop intelligente crawlers.
